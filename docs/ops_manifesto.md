# ðŸ§  NECTR_AI Operational Manifesto

This system was not built to chase trends.  
It was forged to survive discontinuity.

## Principles

- Collapse-aware by design
- Sovereignty-first, API-last
- Agents born small, grow wise
- Documentation is doctrine, not decoration
- Simulate failure before failure simulates you

## Kill Lattice

Each agent includes a kill-switch architecture:
- Soft abort â†’ isolate â†’ container halt â†’ host process shutdown

## Commit Ethics

- `[core]` for agent logic
- `[ops]` for operational scaffolds
- `[deceit]` for deception logic
- `[mem]` for memory architecture
- `[doc]` for documentation or symbolic guidance
