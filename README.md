# 🧠 NECTR_AI  
**Networked Embryonic Cognitive Threat Response**  
> A collapse-resilient, agent-based AI system for honeynet deployment, PvX adversarial simulation, semantic defense, and polymorphic swarm operations.

---

## 🧬 Project Identity

NECTR_AI is more than code — it is an **intelligent operational mesh** built to:

- 🐣 Birth autonomous, minimal agents capable of self-proliferation, self-healing, and self-optimization
- 🛡️ Execute Purple Teaming logic across PvP / PvE / NP-grade adversarial environments
- 🍯 Deploy honeypots, honeynets, and honeyswarms with semantic mimicry and trap telemetry
- 🧠 Route signal across polymorphic swarms via symbolic, strategic, or rule-based logic
- ⚖️ Maintain homeostasis under semantic drift, adversarial entropy, and system fracture

## 📌 Core Concepts

<details>
<summary><strong>📖 Core Intelligence Types (INT suffix stack)</strong></summary>

- **SIGINT** – Signal intelligence (network, packet, pattern)
- **OSINT** – Open-source intelligence (web, feeds, civic data)
- **HUMINT** – Human-agent intelligence (user feedback, prompts)
- **LINGINT** – Linguistic intelligence (LLM-driven parsing)
- **SEMINT** – Semantic-poiesis intelligence (symbol drift detection)
- **MUTINT** – Mutative intelligence (behavioral mutation tracking)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🛡️ OPSEC Team Roles</strong></summary>

- 🟥 **Red Team** – Adversarial agent behavior simulation
- 🟦 **Blue Team** – Detection, alerting, defense scaffolding
- 🟪 **Purple Team** – Real-time feedback + iteration
- ⚪ **White Team** – Logging, observability, kill-switch logic
- 🟪 **HoneyTeam** – Swarm of decoy agents trained to lure & learn from attackers
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🕷️ Deception Infrastructure</strong></summary>

- 🍯 **Honeypots** – Static, trap-laden mock services
- 🐝 **Honeynets** – Dynamic threat simulation environments
- 🌪 **HONEYSWARM** – AI-driven decoys & adaptive swarms with agentic feedback routing
</details>

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🧬 **Embryonic Agent Framework** — Fast-birth, self-contained cognitive units
- ♻️ **Feedback Loop** — Self-healing logic w/ source retry + auto-disable
- 🛡️ **Purple Teaming Layer** — Live Red/Blue iteration across agent spectrum
- 🕸️ **PvP / PvE / NP Modeling** — Adversarial logic routed through game-state engines
- 🧵 **Swarm Routing** — Semantic, symbolic, or rule-based agent coordination
- 🍯 **Trap Telemetry** — Logs, decoys, and deceptive signals yield training data
- 🔗 **Chain of Trust / Provenance** — SBOM-style integrity trails + kill lattice
- 🧠 **Persona Modulation** — Agents can assume different personas dynamically

## 🧰 Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **WSL2 / Ubuntu / VPS / Termux-compatible**
- **SQLite / JSONL**
- **CLI-first / REPL-ready / Cron-capable**
- **Local-first / Offline-operable**
- Optional Docker or containerized swarm mode

🧠 Manifesto Excerpt
NECTR_AI is not built for the hype cycle.
It is designed for collapse, continuity, and covenant.
Its agents don’t just react — they remember, mutate, and adapt.
This is not software. This is semantic infrastructure for the next threshold.
